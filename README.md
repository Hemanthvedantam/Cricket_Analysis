# Cricket Analysis Data Science Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes cricket match data to extract insights into player performance, team strategies, and match outcomes. The goal is to use data science techniques such as exploratory data analysis (EDA), machine learning, and data visualization to derive meaningful insights from cricket datasets.

## 🗂 Dataset
**Dataset Name:** Cricket Match Data (CSV format)

**Data Sources:** Kaggle, ESPN Cricinfo, CricketArchive, or self-collected data.

**Key Features:**
- Match ID, Date, Venue, Teams
- Player statistics (runs, wickets, strike rate, economy rate, etc.)
- Team performance (total runs, wickets lost, extras, run rate, etc.)
- Weather conditions (temperature, humidity, rain probability)
- Toss decision and match outcome

## 🏏 Objectives
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, data transformation, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: 
  - Batting & bowling performance trends
  - Home vs. away team analysis
  - Toss impact on match results
- **Predictive Modeling**: 
  - Predict match outcomes using classification models.
  - Forecast player performance based on historical data.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating insightful dashboards and plots using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Power BI/Tableau.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python (Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab)
- **Libraries Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks
- **Visualization Tools**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Power BI/Tableau

## 📊 Key Insights
- Teams winning the toss and choosing to bat first have a higher win percentage in certain stadiums.
- Strike rate and average partnerships play a crucial role in successful chases.
- Spinners tend to perform better in subcontinental conditions compared to pacers.
- Predictive models achieved an accuracy of **75-85%** in predicting match outcomes.

## 🔍 How to Use the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cricket-analysis.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Load the dataset and execute the analysis.

## 📌 Future Enhancements
- Improve prediction models with deep learning techniques (LSTMs for time-series data).
- Implement a web dashboard using **Streamlit** or **Dash**.
- Include real-time match data scraping and analysis.
